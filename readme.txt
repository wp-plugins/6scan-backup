== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How often is my site backed up? =

By default, we perform a full backup of your site once a week.  You may upgrade to daily backups through the link provided on your dashboard.

= How many previous backups are stored in the cloud? =

By default, we store two previous full backups.  You may upgrade to 15 or 30 stored backups through the link provided on your dashboard.  Having more stored backups is useful in case it takes you a few days to notice a problem has surfaced, and you want to restore a backup from up to a full month back.

The backup includes:

* All the files under your web root (this includes your themes, plugins, uploaded images, etc. -- everything on your website).

These two items are all you need to fully restore your site on a clean server.

= Can anybody else access my backups? =

Our backups are securely stored such that only you can access your backups, using a special key created for you when you activate the plugin.

All backups are stored in our secure cloud-based datacenter, as tar.gz archives, a standard format understood by all common archiving programs (such as WinRAR or WinZIP on Windows, and standard utilities bundled with Linux).

= How are the backups transferred? =

Backups are transferred to our datacenter using the industry-standard encrypted HTTPS protocol to prevent eavesdropping and data theft.

There is nothing to set up!  Storage space is automatically allocated for you when you start your first backup.

6Scan Backup supports all common Wordpress configurations, and we regularly test it with many large hosting providers.  In the rare case that your system is not compatible, your backup dashboard will explain what needs to be done and provide full instructions.
